<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! This is Mohammed Nuaman M, son of Mukaram Pasha. I'm 20 years of age, born on 7th May 2004.
I completetd my primary in St Francis ICSE School, Chamarajanagar. I secured 81.3% in my 10th class.
For my higher primary, i joined Sadvidya Composite PU College, Mysore and secured 86.5% in distinction class.</p>

<p>I have opted Computer Science and Engineering as my professional course in Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering(SJCE), Mysore.
I am in 4th sem(2nd year) currently. I opted this course because I love computers.
Especially, in my childhood, I used to play a lot of PC games which is a memory to me, forever. 
I want to know more about computers, i.e, how it actually functions.</p>

<p>I bought a course on Udemy to learn about Web Development, by Angela Yu, and the journey is going great.
I am learning a lot of new things which I have not heard of my entire life, which is fascianting. This is challenge to me,
as there are thousands of coders around the world, and to be the best coder in the world. By coding, I actually want to 
contribute to the people by making or providing things, which they can not have at hand(eg:amazon).</p>

<p>I accept the challenge and the journey does not stop here, I have many more things to learn and I will do it.</p>
